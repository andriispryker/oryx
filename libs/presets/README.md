# presets

The presets package contains opinionated presets that are convenient to use as quick starters. The presets are build to demonstrate a certain type of application in a fast manner.

The presets are likely not the perfect production setup for your project, as it comes with a full feature set. In a production setup, you might want to skip some features that included in the preset.
