# Oryx Internationalization package

Provides internationalization (i18n) to Oryx applications. Internationalization is mainly concerned with the translation of so-called site labels in components. The internationalization features allow to customise site labels without customising the UI.

## Installation

`npm install @spryker-oryx/i18n`

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test i18n` to execute your test suite with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and code coverage by default. You can pass options `--watch`, `--dev`, `--related`, `--run` (using by default) to run [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) in different modes.
